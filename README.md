# Lazy_Eye_Examination
<p> LAZY EYE ( amblyopia) often occurs when there is a significant difference in vision between the two eyes, leading the brain to rely more on the eye with better vision and gradually ignore or suppress the visual signals from the weaker eye. This lack of visual stimulation and proper use of the weaker eye can result in reduced visual acuity and poor visual development. So here we made a device to measure sight acuity.</p>

 ## Idea 
<p> <b>E chart</b> is a commonly used method to assess visual acuity by measuring how well a person can see and distinguish details at a specific distance.
The patient will be asked to aim at certain points on the mirror so the patient can hit targets on the board behind them. Each eye is tested separately, while the other eye is covered with an occluder.

According to the patient's score of each eye while
hitting the targets, we determine the possibility of presence of a LAZY EYE, if so we have a long-term
treatment protocol for him to follow, that's done by "mirror therapy." This therapy aims to encourage the weaker eye to actively participate in visual tasks
andstrengtheni t svisualprocessingabilities.</p>
